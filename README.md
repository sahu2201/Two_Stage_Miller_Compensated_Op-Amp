# Two_Stage_Miller_Compensated_Op-Amp
Two Stage Miller Compensated Op-Amp with Single Ended Output

Designed a Two-Stage Miller Compensated Operational Amplifier with 130nm Technology node using LTSpice simulation.
The amplifier was configured to attain a loop gain of 56dB, a phase margin of 73.5 degrees, and a unity gain frequency of
47MHz and achieved a closed-loop 3dB bandwidth of 67MHz.
